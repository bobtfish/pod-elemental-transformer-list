=for list
1. foo
    Foo is an important aspect of foo.  It really is.
2. bar
3. baz
    Baz is also important, but compared to Foo, Baz isn't even Bar.

=begin list

1. foo

    Foo is an important aspect of foo.
    
2. bar

    Bar is also important, and takes options:
    
    = height
    
       It's supplied in in pixels.

    = width
    
       It's supplied in inches.
       
    And those are all of them.
    
3. baz

    Reasons why Baz is important:

    * it's delicious like L<Net::Delicious>
    * it's nutritious
    * it's seditious
